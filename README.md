Full-stack developer with more than a decade of experience who loves JavaScript, CSS, serverless architecture, and rapid deployment.

Used to working as part of small teams; Agile working, Waterfall methodology, or more ad-hoc styles of planning.

Plenty of experience developing and deploying to AWS. Still have a bunch of commonly used UNIX commands memorised from when I used to manage my own servers.

In the front-end I like to use React, Next.js, and SASS. Behind the scenes I prefer Node.js, but I know my way around Python and PHP too.
